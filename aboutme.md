My name is Peter Glotfelty and I'm a software developer at Microsoft. I grew up in the midwest, and spent a summer
interning at MS before deciding to come back full time in 2016 to the Windows Developer Group. Since then,
I've moved teams, and I currently work on the Azure Machine Learning team doing infrastructure work.

In my free time, I tinker with lots of different corners of the things and maintain a popular [rust][1] library
called [strum][2].
